# Lazy-loading VRScans Library

Here is a brief overview of the project's functionality:

- This is a project based on React that showcases VR-Scan materials.
- To review the materials, you need to sign up for a free account. Once signed up, you will automatically be logged in. (Sessions last for 30 days)
- If you want to make changes to your account details, you can go to your profile page and upload a photo or update your name or email from there.
- The VR-Scans library allows you to review all the materials available in our database. We have a full-text search and multiple filters to help you navigate and review any VR-scan of your choice.
- Don't be afraid of our extensive collection of VR-Scans. Navigating through it is fast and simple.
- You can interact with any materials that you see. For example, you can review their details to find out the maker of the material and also mark them as your favorites. We will save your favorites in an easily accessible collection, so the materials youâ€™re fond of most will be remembered.
